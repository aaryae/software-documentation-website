                <h3>What is Software documentation?</h3>
                <p>In the software development process, software documentation is the information that describes the
                    product to the people who develop, deploy and use it.<br><br>

                    It includes the technical manuals and online material, such as online versions of manuals and help
                    capabilities. The term is sometimes used to refer to source information about the product discussed
                    in
                    design documentation, code comments, white papers and session notes.<br><br>

                    Software documentation is a way for engineers and programmers to describe their product and the
                    process
                    they used in creating it in formal writing. Early computer users were sometimes simply given the
                    engineers' or programmers' notes. As software development became more complicated and formalized,
                    technical writers and editors took over the documentation process.<br><br>

                    Software documentation shows what the software developers did when creating the software and what IT
                    staff and users must do when deploying and using it. Documentation is often incorporated into the
                    software's user interface and also included as part of help documentation. The information is often
                    divided into task categories, including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>evaluating</li>
                    <li>planning</li>
                    <li>setting up or installing</li>
                    <li>customizing</li>
                    <li>administering</li>
                    <li>using</li>
                    <li>maintaining</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>Why is it important?</h1>
                <hr>
                <h3>Why is software documentation important?</h3>
                <p>
                    Software documentation provides information about a software program for everyone involved in its
                    creation, deployment and use. Documentation guides and records the development process. It also
                    assists with basic tasks such as installation and troubleshooting.<br><br>

                    Effective documentation gets users familiar with the software and makes them aware of its features.
                    It can have a significant role in driving user acceptance. Documentation can also reduce the burden
                    on support teams, because it gives users the power to troubleshoot issues.<br><br>

                    Software documentation can be a living document that is updated over the software development
                    lifecycle. Its use and the communication it encourages with users provides developers with
                    information on problems users have with the software and what additional features they need.
                    Developers can respond with software updates, improving customer satisfaction and user experience.

                <h1>Types of software documentation</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>The two main types of software documentation are internal and external.</p>
                <h2>Internal software documentation</h2>
                <p>Developers and software engineers create internal documentation that is used inside a company.
                    Internal documentation may include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Administrative documentation.</li>
                    <p>This is the high-level administrative guidelines, roadmaps and product requirements for the
                        software development team and project managers working on the software. It also may include
                        status reports and meeting notes.</p>
                    <li>Developer documentation.</li>
                    <p> This provides instructions to developers for building the software and guides them through the
                        development process. It includes requirements documentation, which describes how the software
                        should perform when tested. It also includes architectural documentation that focuses on how all
                        the components and features work together, and details data flows throughout the product.</p>
                </ul>
                
                <h4 class="underline">Types of software requirements</h4>

                </table>
                



                <h2>External software documentation</h2>
                <p> Software developers create this documentation to provide IT managers and end users with information
                    on
                    how to deploy and use the software. External documentation includes the following:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> End-user documentation. </li>
                    <p>This type gives end users basic instructions on how to use, install and
                        troubleshoot the software. It might provide resources, such as user guides, knowledge bases,
                        tutorials
                        and release notes.</p>
                    <li>Enterprise user documentation.</li>
                    <p>Enterprise software often has documentation for IT staff who deploy the
                        software across the enterprise. It may also provide documentation for the end users of the
                        software.</p>
                    <li>Just-in-time documentation.</li>
                    <p>This provides end users with support documentation at the exact time they
                        will need it. This allows developers to create a minimal amount of documentation at the release
                        of a
                        software product and add documentation as new features are added. It is based on the Agile
                        software
                        development These can be knowledge bases, FAQ pages and how-to documents.</p>

                <h1>Best practices for creating software documentation</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>There are six common best practices for creating software documentation. They are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Understand user needs.</li>
                    <p>Developers must understand user needs and pain points from the start of the development process.
                        The documentation should address those needs and provide help around pain points.</p>
                    <li>Write easily understood doucmentation.</li>
                    <p>Documentation should be concise, simple and avoid complex jargon. It should use terms and phrases
                        that the intended audience would use.</p>
                    <li>Include internal subject matter experts.</li>
                    <p>It can help to have experienced team members and subject matter experts in the software
                        documentation process to ensure that it is accurate.</p>
                    <li>Use analytics feedback.</li>
                    <p> Analytics applications provide important feedback that can be incorporated into documentation.
                    </p>
                    <li>Ask for user feedback.</li>
                    <p> After a release, ask users what they liked and disliked about a software product and use the
                        input to improve both the product and its documentation.</p>
                    <li>Provide continuous maintenance.</li>
                    <p>As software is updated and maintained, the accompanying documentation should also be updated.
                        Teams must constantly improve documentation as IT and user questions reveal additional needs.
                    </p>
